    <h1>3 Days</h1>
    <p>3 Days. Well unfortunately it’s the same day, not even an hour apart lol. I really wanted to do it so that you get a paragraph every single day, but due to our unfortunate exam schedule and week I wasn’t able to do it. It literally sucks soo much. I also really wanted to do something special for you tonight, but I’m sorry I wasn’t able to. Don’t worry though I have something planned for when you come back. Obviously I’m not going to through a party but it’s going to be something you will enjoy. Hopefully. Actually no I know you’re going to enjoy it. I just have to figure out how to plan it. I have an interesting idea in mind, but I don’t know how to execute. If the weather was better it would’ve been soo much fun. Bu the day you come back we are going on a nostalgia date. I’ll let you guess what that would entail. I just want you to know that even though we technically are hitting a year now you were going to be mine forever since day one. Anyways 3 months ago was November. It was our nine month. I mean it was a very chill month. If I remember correctly this was when you surprised me with the cupcakes at midnight. I mean I knew something as going on literally the entire day. Let me just say you’re absolutely garbage at keeping a secret lol. You cannot keep something a secret to save your life. It was soo sweet though Shreya. Like I remember I was just cracking away at your homework, and I was thinking there is no way I’m slaving away right now. I literally remember texting you and you left, and I was like wtf. Then seeing you come out with the cupcakes was soo cute and sweet. I loved it soo much. It was one of the best moments ever. Soo cute, fun, and sweet. I love you soo much Shreya. I just need you to know that I will never stop loving you. Till the end of the universe and back. Forever. Always.</p>
