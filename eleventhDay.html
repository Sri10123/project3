    <h1>1 Day</h1>
    <p>1 Day. It’s literally the final countdown. So technically I’m writing the correct paragraph today. If you read the past paragraphs, hopefully you did, you would know that I have literally written three today soo far. But today is officially the correct paragraph relating to the day. Today is an intersting day because I want to write the paragraph for one year but I still need to write about our 11 monthaversary. So this will be a paragraph relating to the 11 monthaversary. Your 1 year paragraph will come tomorrow. Don’t get upset. If you get upset I will know that you didn’t read this paragraph. So there is a lot on the line here Shreya. Lol. This is on you. Anyways I believe our 11 monthaversarsy was a very chill night, due to the upcoming one year anniversary. But if you think about there is nothing as a chill night for us. Lmao. But I genuinely enjoy spending a chill night with you. Like getting food, relaxing, laying down in bed, and watching Netflix. Literally the definition of Netflix and chill. I literally cannot wait for when we do this when we grow up. Instead we will have a nice ass TV, hopefully some money, and a shit ton of snacks. Just being able to spend that time with you is the best thing I can ask for Shreya. If you can’t tell what I’m talking about, I just absolutely love spending time with you. Being in the same room with you, being next to you, being with you is all I can ask for. I don’t know if you can see but my face literally lights up. Just being with you is all I can ever ask for. I mean at this point in our relationship that’s very obviously lol. Literally when I’m not with you I miss you soo much. I honestly hate it when I’m not with you. Why do you think I tend to spend time with my family or friends when I’m back home. That’s literally the only thing I can do which helps me from missing you. It’s the biggest reason I spend all that time with them so I can literally stop thinking about how much I miss you. Okay before you read that and think of it in the wrong way, please don’t. All I’m saying is that I need to just immerse myself in something to distract myself. I don’t really know how to describe it but whatever you don’t take it the wrong way lol. I’m sorry if this is coming out wrong. I swear I don’t mean it in a bad way. I just want to say that I literally can’t handle being without you and not being with you just sucks. I love you soo much Shreya. Till the end of the universe and back. Forever and always. </p>
