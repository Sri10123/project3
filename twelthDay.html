    <h1>HAPPY 1 YEAR</h1>
    <p>0 Days. Well that doesn’t really make sense. But who cares. HAPPY ONE YEAR SHREYA. We finally made it. I know it’s not technically the day of our one year, but we both said we would send our paragraphs on sunday. Regardless Imma pretend like today is our one year anniversary. Even though our relationship is 1 year and 22 hours old. I genuinely can’t believe it. Like I didn’t think I would make it to this point at this age. Like if you asked me at the beginning of college if I saw myself here I would say no. But I have never been happier in my life. This is literally one of the greatest moments in my life. Looking back at the time we have spent together, I can definitely say it has been the best of my entire life. I mean I can kinda break it up into four different phases. Freshman year, Summer, first sem Sophomore year, and now. 

    Phase 1. Looking back at freshman year. It feels like it was soo long ago. Honestly I really do miss it. I was going to talk to get some pizza from Pete Za and I was thinking about freshman year. Technically we knew each other the moment we started classes. Like we were in the same class first semester. Second semester freshman year was where it all began. I remember the days we would just spend in WALC. Literally would spend the entire day there. It first started off in Starbucks, and then we slowly moved other WALC. You were sleeping in Angelus’s dorm because of your issues with Raina. I mean holy shit, there was soo much that had happened that semester. Soo much that had happened the first couple weeks we came back from break. I mean we were just friends at that point. We weren’t even talking, like occasionally we would text each other, and occasionally we would study together. I had switched my class to be in the same one as Angelus. Like soo much had happened. Slowly we started becoming closer, like I would need a full ass invite before I came and studied with you guys at WALC. Then Wiley night happened. I remember going out to some party with my friends and then running into Angelus there. I remember going back to my other friends in Tark. Then I remember getting a phone call rom you asking me to come over. Then one thing led to another and I had quite literally fallen asleep in your bed. I was going to say slept the night with you, but like thats not technically correct. Like you know what I mean. Anyway that really did spark the entire thing, then I got the balls to ask you to go to dinner the next day. I mean, to be honest, I didn’t really mean it as a date because I didn’t know you had to specify it to be a date. Like it was more of a let’s go get dinner after we slept in the same bed together drunk. So yea. But the way that sparked the entire future of our relationship is crazy. I mean if that night didn’t happen I don’t think we would be hitting one year right now. I mean I’m sure we would’ve still gotten together, but definitely would not be our one year anniversary today. Who knows when we would’ve gotten together, maybe an alternate timeline has the answer. But who cares. Like the way it was my first relationship and the way my friends were hyping me up, it was amazing. Like there was a perfect balance then. I was able to spend time with my friends at Tark and then come back to Cary and spend time with you. Life couldn’t be more perfect. What a time, like I genuinely miss it.

    Phase 2. Summer. The first time we actually hit long distance relationship. I mean we did a short stint during spring break, but that doesn’t really count. Like we were just starting our relationship. But when we first started Summer it was really intersting. Like we had no idea what do, like we really went in blind. But I think we thought we were prepared but trust me we had no idea what was happening. Like the first couple weeks were intersting, we were just chilling and slowly it hit us like a train. I mean it was tough during the last couple months of Summer but I’m soo happy that we made it out. We were able to push through and I’m soo glad we did. Like we had soo much going on during Summer. You started off going to Cancun (rich asf). Then I started going to work and then you started going to work. Then you started classes and then I started classes. Then I went on vacation and then you started your morning classes. Like soo much happened. Literally Summer felt like an eternity. It was soo long but like looking back it doesn’t feel real. It feels like an eternity ago. I think back and honestly I just don’t think it happened. Like I get this sort of nostalgic feeling thinking about it. I mean I also get that feeling thinking about second semester of freshman year. Hm weird. I also get the feeling thinking about first semester lmao. If I’m being honest I get that feeling when I think about anything from the past. I mean whenever I go home I see the pictures my family took in India and Dubai and thats when it doesn’t feel real. Like it immediately brings back all the memories of our long distance relationship. I know it had its ups and downs but it truly made us stronger. I feel as though we connected soo much deeper emotionally after Summer. I have no idea how to describe but it felt different coming back from the Summer. Like a lot had changed. We were soo dependent on each other and then we became really independent during that time I was international. So we had many different things going on. Realistically I know you might say Summer wasn’t the best for us, but I don’t think about all that. All I do is associate with the good memories, and how we grew closer. That if we were able to make it through Summer we can make it through anything. 

    Phase 3. First semester sophomore year. Although it wasn’t a very long time ago, it really does feel like a century ago. I mean honestly it feels like life was a lot different during that first semester. I mean I honestly can’t remember what it’s like to have good weather at Purdue. I remember my dumbass would walk from Hawkins to hilltop constantly because I didn’t know how to use the bus system. I don’t know if it was a good thing or bad thing that I was soo close to campus last year. I genuinely never used the bus unless it was to go to Walmart. Everything was literally within 10 minutes making it walkable. I was also in a big predicament during that first semester, because my parents were constantly checking my location. So I didn’t want them to know I was over at Hawkins all the time. So I still remember those long ass walks I would make early in the morning or late at night back to my dorm. Holy fuck I had some crazy ass legs. What a time. I mean I’m talking like I’m an expert now, but I don’t know it really does feel different this semester. I mean we fell into the flow of living in our dorms and the classes, so everything has been smoother. I mean it was our first semester back to Purdue from Summer. We were still getting into the rhythm of seeing each other everyday, especially with a completely new living situation. I mean now I was sleeping over in your dorm and it isn’t a really close walk between our dorms anymore. But I can’t say it was a bad semester. Because I had a lot of fun, I mean there was some obvious fights and other things, but it was still a fantastic semester. We did a lot of things during that time. Like when I truly think about last semester I’m basically only referring to the beginning of the semester. I wouldn’t really count the end of the semester, as that basically aligns with now. I guess a more accurate description would be regarding the change in weather. Like when we still had the ability to wear shorts and not walk around campus in a huge ass jacket. Man I miss the Summer, to an extent tho. Like I don’t want it to be boiling hot again, cause that isn’t fun. Like I miss being able to just go on walks without having to stop in a building every 5 minutes. I can’t wait till we can go back on our walk to the bridge, or eat ice cream without being scared of getting a cold, or go back to Indy. So yea that is definitely something. 

    Final Phase. Now. By the phases I’m not necessarily talking about the different semesters of school we had, it’s more the different stages in our relationship. But I feel like that ties into the different semesters of school we had. Like last semester, the beginning of the semester felt very different compared to the end of the semester. Like if you look at it now the end of the last semester isn’t that much different compared to this semester. If you think about the future I’m sure the beginning of our junior year is going to be very different compared to the end of that first semester. I don’t really know how to describe it, but I tried. We really have grown comfortable together Shreya. We literally do everything together. I don’t think there is a day where we have both been on campus that we have spend without each other. Maybe it’s due to the fact of how we were really close friends before we started dating. I mean we would be spending everyday together even before we were dating. So maybe that plays a huge factor. Honestly I really don’t know. But I’m not complaining. I mean the two weekends you were gone for competitions I was bored out of my mind. I don’t know if that’s a good thing or bad thing lol. Like if you look at it it’s really sweet saying that I don’t know what to do without you there. But is it also kind of lame saying I have no friends and I have no life other than being with you. Like my life has completely changed. I rely on you for everything now. I barely spend time in my own dorm. I barely see my friends lol. I’m not saying this in a bad way. It has genuinely changed. I really do love you Shreya. The things I do for you should be enough proof of this statement. I really don’t have words to describe how I feel for you Shreya. To a point it’s scary, like I know I would do anything for you. Like I don’t know what I would do without you in my life. If I said that to someone else they would be like thats a really good thing, it shows how much you love her. I agree. Like I love you soo much I’m scared. I love you soo much I can’t fathom living life without you. There is genuinely no words to describe how much I love you Shreya. I know I have said this many times, but I will keep saying it. I truly do love you with everything in my being. I knew this since the first moment I said the words I love you, but this past couple weeks has really shown me just how much I feel for you. The only way I was able to convey it was through actions. There are no words to describe it. I can’t wait to grow old with you Shreya. I can’t wait to spend the rest of my life with you. I can’t wait to have kids, a house, travel, dogs, and literally anything else that a family would do. I can’t wait to do all that with you. You’re the only person I ever want to do those things with. I love you soo much. Till the end of the universe and back. Forever. Always.</p>
