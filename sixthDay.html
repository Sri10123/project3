    <h1>6 Days</h1>
    <p>6 Days. Halfway point Shreya. I know today didn’t go the way you wanted it to go but don’t think about it. This has been a hectic week for you guys and for you especially. You absolutely cooked on that stage. You performed your ass off. You were stunning and just amazing to watch. Don’t for a second think it was your fault. You were absolutely perfect up there. I was soo proud watching you. I genuinely fell in love all over again. I literally couldn’t keep my eyes off of you. And if you remember 6 months ago we came back to Purdue. It was our first time seeing each other since before Summer. I know technically our six months wasn’t at Purdue but we celebrated it when we got back. I remember we were meant to celebrate it on the night I flew in but it got really hectic and we couldn’t. Bro I was soo scared you were going to be mad at me the entire time. I was literally shaking, I was soo fucking scared. Like I was mad conflicted. Cause obviously I wanted to spend time with you but I also wanted to spend time with my family. I’m soo happy we were able to figure it out and everything worked. Honestly it worked out way better than I expected. Like I had such a good idea in mind and I really wanted it to work, but thank god I was able to improvise and find another valid plan. We sure made it work. I’m soo happy for that. Getting to dress up and get those pictures was literally amazing. Like no offense but I stole the show on those pictures. I mean did u see how good I looked. Jk. Jk. Jk. I’m just kidding. Like bro for real though, you looked soo beautiful. You looked absolutely perfect. I literally look back at those pictures when I miss you. Like even when you’re there I look back at those pictures. You looked soo stunning in that dress. I literally have no words for how beautiful you looked that day. I was deadass mind blown. I think it’s time for me to come clean. The original plan wasn’t actually a picnic. Baking the cookies was definitely part of the plan. Don’t worry I had that the whole time. My plan was actually to take you up on the roof at night and light a couple candles, and have a candle lit dinner with some Taco Bell. I mean we got like 70% of my orignal plan. The Taco Bell was there and the cookie making was there, only part missing was the rooftop dinner. I actually read it in a book somewhere, so I really wanted to try it. I deadass tried climbing onto the roof, and unfortunately I couldn’t find anything viable. Which sucks because I think that would’ve been really fun. Regardless I still remember the day like it was yesterday. It was phenomenal. Seeing you in that dress. Getting to spend that time together. That’s all I ever wanted. Was to spend that time with you. I couldn’t care what we do, as long as you’re there with me. I love you soo much Shreya. Till the end of the universe and back. Forever. Always. </p>
