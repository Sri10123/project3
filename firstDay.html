    <h1>11 Days</h1>
    <p>11 Days. That's how many days we have until we hit one year. Can you actually believe that. It genuinely feels like yesterday when we first started dating. I look back and I think about how far we have come. That month was very eventful but it was a very crucial one. It was like the first phase in our relationship. We were soo young back then. Classes were still easy. Our relationship was soo young. There was soo much back then that was different. I look back and I think those were some great days, but I wouldn’t give it up for what we have now. I still remember the time I asked you out. On Valentine’s Day, I was lowkey mad clueless because I didn’t even know I had to ask the question “will you be my girlfriend” to make it official. Then when you told me in the morning I was like wtf. Because I knew I had to figure something out in order to make it happen. It wanted it to be really special and what other day that Valentine’s day. I remember going around getting flowers with Xander and then practicing my speech the entire time. It was a really great time. Seeing you that day when the door opened my mind actually went blank. Shreya I don’t think you understand, you looked soo beautiful. I was genuinely speechless. Like I had this whole goddamn speech setup and everything and I completely forgot. I was like uhhhh wtf do I say now. So I winged it. I don’t think you understand everything that came out of my mouth after that was from looking at you. Don’t worry I didn’t forget what I said. “Shreya you’re really beautiful, sometimes funny, smart when you want to be”. That one line is one I will never forget. I was soo nervous and happy at the same time to ask you to be my girlfriend. But oh man it payed off. It has turned into the happiest year of my life. It has given me a year of memories, happiness, joy, anger, and literally any and every emotion known to mankind. What I’m trying to say is that I knew this day would come. I knew we would make it this far. The moment I set my eyes on you in that room I knew for a fact I was going to spend the rest of my life with you. I knew I was going to love you for the rest of my life. That one month that set everything up. That month was the greatest month of my life. Being together officially and being able to tell everyone you’re mine was the best thing ever. I love you to the end of the universe and back. Forever. Always.</p>
