    <h1>7 Days</h1>
    <p>7 Days. Time is ticking down. Unfortunately you go away for the weekend. I don’t know what I’m going to do without you for the weekend. I’m literally going to submerge myself in work, I lowkey need to study anyway. Like I don’t know what else to do. I have nothing to do without you. Like I feel okay right now because you’re still here, but when you’re actually gone I’m going to be soo bored. I truly am going to miss you. Also exactly 7 months ago we were still in Summer. So we are unfortunately back to long distance. You’re back on the west coast standard time and I’m still on Eastern standard time. We are back to being 3 hours apart. Like we are in literally doing lost distance again. I hate long distance. But if you remember 7 months ago we were on ultra long distance. I was in Dubai and India during this time. The month was a very up and down month. We had some slight problems during the month. We both were just missing each other soo much and long distance finally took a toll on us. I truly apologize for everything I did and everything I put you through. We were almost an entire day apart during that time. We barely were able to talk, I mean I was alway busy with something. There was no time for us to even see each other. I mean I was on a whole ass bike trip where I didn’t even have data. I literally had to ask the uncle to turn on his data just so I could text you. It was genuinely crazy. Soo much happened during that month. It’s hard to describe everything. I was a few continents away. But we still managed to make it work. I know it wasn’t easy, but we still did it. Shreya honestly if we made it through that month we can make it through anything. That month was a literal roller coaster. Every emotion, every action, every single thing that could’ve happened literally happened. Name it and it happened. It was a genuine crazy month. But I’m soo glad we were able to make it through. Because I wouldn’t want to his this one year milestone with anyone else. This milestone was reserved for you the day I had met you. I knew that you were the girl I was going to spend the rest of my life with. I mean if we were able to conquer that treacherous month, we are together forever. I don’t think you understand how much I was thinking of you. Literally every day and every minute was me thinking about you. It was soo hard not being able to even see your face. I had missed you soo much, every waking second was spent thinking about you. I honestly wish you were there with me Shreya. I wish I could spend that month traveling the world with you. I can’t wait to do that with you, I can’t wait to see every beautiful place in the world with you. I can’t wait to have that all. I love you soo much. Till the end of the universe and back. Forever. Always.</p>
