    <h1>8 Days</h1>
    <p>8 Days. The clock is constantly ticking. Like if it wasn’t for our busy schedules with exams and everything I think we would’ve been celebrating more. But it’s a good thing that after your second competition we have a semi free week so we should be free to celebrate and stay up. Honestly it’s still crazy to me that we are hitting our one year anniversary. Like think about it we have gone through soo many phases already. Like this is our third semester of school being together. Can you believe it. That’s actually crazy to think about. Like what. Three whole semesters of school. Basically four if you count Summer. And that’s exactly where we were 8 months ago. In the middle of Summer. This is when both of us had our jobs and classes, so even though it was summer we were kinda packed. Like it wasn’t a crazy month either. We were finally into the thick of summer break, so we were both used to long distance. Still hurt and sucked soo much. I hated not being able to see you everyday. I mean literally during freshman year we were together all the time. Our relationship basically just started, and we were thrown into long distance. But we made it work. It wasn’t the prettiest, not exactly butterflies and rainbows. It got the job done. I still hate it soo much. Like I wish you lived nearby back home. So at least I have the opportunity to see you whenever I want. Facetiming and texting isn’t the same at all as being with you in person. The difference was soo much it was lowkey really hard. I mean I was constantly waiting for you to text back. I was trying to busy myself in any way possible. I just wanted to be with you again. It sucked that I wasn’t able to. But we made it through, fought hard. It was a very smooth month I would say. Other than a few hiccups but that just had to do with us being in long distance for the first time. Everything still went alright. I’m happy we made it through. Whether we like it or not we are going to go back to it very soon. Hopefully this time we are both really busy so we don’t have to worry too much. Still, I know we will be perfectly fine. I love you till the end of the univers end back. Forever. Always.  </p>
