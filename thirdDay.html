    <h1>9 Days</h1>
    <p>9 Days. We have single digit for days now. Soo close Shreya. Can you believe it. Literally less than 10 days and we have been together for a whole year now. I mean does it even feel real. Like still feels surreal. Like I know nothing physically is going to change, like we aren’t going to get random fireworks out of nowhere. Or like we are magically going to become superheroes or smth. It’s still huge change. It still feels really big for us. Like hitting a year together while we are soo young. It’s no small feat. If you remember correctly this was our first Summer monthaversary. If I remember correctly the first website I made you was for our three monthaversary. So kinda full circle moment lol. Like almost nine months ago I had made u a website for our anniversary and now for our one year anniversary I’m also making you a website. Kinda crazy. Honestly the first summer month was interesting. We were getting used to it. We literally almost just began our relationship and two out of the three months were already online. Last one was only a week long. This time it was almost four months long. Summer was finally hitting. We were doing long distance for real. I mean you literally went to Cancun too. You were already out and about. Vacationing to start of the summer. I had picked up work. It honestly was a very mello month. Can’t say anything crazy. I remember back then I was soo bored too I was waiting every second for your text. Don’t worry I still am. We need to compare my response time with your response time. Lol. I literally had nothing else to do. I don’t even think I was playing that much videogames. Anyways that month was a good month. It’s intersting to see how we were able to balance long distance. If I were to go back now I would definitely tell our past selves to watch Netflix. But still it was a great time. I had gotten over my weird thing where I wouldn’t call you unless I knew you were free. Oh boy what a time. Still happy we made it through that long distance. I mean we wouldn’t be here otherwise. Literally 9 months ago Shreya. That’s when we started our Summer journey. But we had made it here, soo far. I’m soo proud and happy. I love you soo much. To the end of the universe and back. Forever. Always. </p>
