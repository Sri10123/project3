    <h1>5 Days</h1>
    <p>5 Days. The clock is really ticking down now Shreya. Tomorrow I get to see you. Or probably today depending on the time I send this to you. But I was missing you a lot today, I mean we literally haven’t been able to call or text at all. You have been really busy this past weekend and obviously we both got a ton of exams coming up. So studying is definitely number one priority. I can’t wait till this hell week is all done. Then finally we can spend some quality time together without any exams in the way. If you remember 5 months ago on this date we celebrated our first monthaversary in Purdue after summer. I believe this was the anniversary where I was very drunk in Verve. If my memory serves me correctly that is. Oh well. I still made sure to get your paragraph and wish you as soon as the clock struck midnight. I know that was literally only five months ago but it genuinely feels like a lifetime ago Shreya. As I’m writing these paragraphs I think back on our past monthaversaries and just realize how long ago they really were. How we were different people. How we are going to be different people in the future. Like some of the things we argued about were really dumb. I know it’s corny and doesn’t really make sense to say this but we were kids. We were always maturing in our relationship. If you look at the grand scheme of if and the big picture Summer was us really just getting into the relationship. I think when it got like serious serious (I swear I knew it was serious since day one I have no idea how else to describe the feeling) was the last month of Summer. Like there was a huge switch in our relationship and it almost kinda evolved. I like to look back and think about the people we were back then. We genuinely were kids. I like to think we have maturing and gotten better, but realistically we have ways to go. But I don’t have to learn with anyone else. I want to be with you for the rest of my life. I want to grow old with you. I want to have kids with you. I want to see each individual strand of your hair turn grey. I want to die with you Shreya. If you imagine yourself in your past selves shoes I’m sure you were hoping we would make it here. And Shreya, we did. I like to think I used up all my good luck for a lifetime in getting with you. And I wouldn’t have it any other way. If you told me in an alternate universe I would’ve won the lottery if I didn’t get with you, I would say fuck that. Why? Because I had already won the lottery by getting you. Yes I know cheesy. But it honestly came up in my mind, and I know you love cheesiness. I love you soo much Shreya. To the end of the universe and back. Forever. Always.</p>
