    <h1>4 Days</h1>
    <p>4 Days. It technically makes no sense to say in four days we are hitting one year, because it’s literally tomorrow. Or technically in four hours. Yea. That makes more sense. Instead of 4 days, imma say it’s four hours. Well when you get this it won’t necessarily be four hours anymore lol. It’s the thought that counts right? Most importantly we made it out of the hell of hell weeks. Like for real. Shreya this week was no joke, I mean you literally flew in and had ane exam the next day. This week of exam was not for the week. I know not everything went our way but the most important thing is that you didn’t give up. You didn’t throw in the towel although you were insanely tired. I’m soo proud of you for that. You did insanely well. If you remember our 8 month anniversary, we technically celebrated it in Indy. I say technically because we meant to do that for our 6 month because that’s a little bigger than 8, but still we celebrated our 8 months in Indy. I kinda feel mean for saying that, like 8 months wasn’t good enough to deserve Indy, even though it’s literally a monthaversary. I’m rambling a bit, kinda weird the way the brain works am I right. But still we literally had our biggest celebration for a monthaversary during this month. Prolly one of the best days of my life. Getting to spend an entire day with you with no worries about school and exams. Holy shit it was absolutely perfect. Just walking around with the nice weather. Eating nice food, at least some of the food was nice. There was some clear hits and some clear misses. The best part was spending some quality time together. Just having fun walking around the city literally no plan, that was a dream of mine. Just having a carefree afternoon with the person I love the most in the world. I plan to take you again soon, maybe hit up a dinner spot that more fancy and definitely better tasting than the last one. As soon as the weather gets better we will go do something special again in Indy. But having that entire day with you was all I could ever ask for. Literally one of the best days of my life. Shreya like I genuinely love you soo much for that. I love spending that time with you. I just love being with you. Genuinely that was one of the best days of my life. I love you soo much. To the end of the universe and back. Forever. Always. </p>
